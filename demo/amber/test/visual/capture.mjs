/**
 * `fullPage` is a per-page decision, and the guide is the reason it exists.
 *
 * The console is one screen: capturing it whole is both cheap and exactly what
 * the gate is for. The guide is 15,000-27,000px of body text, and capturing it
 * whole cost 11.6MB of baselines — 80% of everything committed to this repo, for
 * six files, re-written in full on every `--update`. Bytes in git are forever;
 * that is a bad trade for a page whose lower two-thirds is prose.
 *
 * So the guide captures one viewport, scrolled to `anchor`. The anchor is the
 * paired-specimen grid in section 06 rather than the top of the section, and
 * that is a deliberate choice of what to spend one screen on: it puts inputs,
 * selects, an invalid field, checkboxes, radios and both toggle variants in
 * frame at once. Those are the states the forced-colors and print fallbacks get
 * wrong, and they are worth more per pixel than the button row above them.
 *
 * WHAT THIS GIVES UP: a visual regression elsewhere on the guide — the swatches,
 * the type specimens, the tables — is no longer caught. Those are documentation
 * of tokens that `npm run contrast` already gates numerically.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT GIVE UP: the overflow probe below walks the entire DOM
 * regardless of what is screenshotted, so the responsive-collapse regression
 * this suite was built for is still gated across the whole guide at every width.
 *
 * `click` exists for the server page and states the one thing the probe cannot
 * reach on its own. A hidden tab panel is display:none, which reports a
 * scrollWidth of zero — so a panel nobody opens is not measured, it is merely
 * absent. The server demo hides its widest markup by far behind a tab (a
 * seven-column table with a switch in every row, which overflowed a 390px frame
 * by 214px the first time it was written), and that is exactly the regression
 * this suite exists to catch. So the page is probed as it loads, the tab is
 * opened, and it is probed again; the worse of the two is what gets reported,
 * and the screenshot is taken of the opened state.
 *
 * `click` TAKES A LIST, because the terminal page carries five pages behind one
 * tablist and opening only the first would leave four of the densest tables in
 * the repo ungated. Each selector is clicked in turn and the page is probed
 * after each; the worst figure across all of them is what gets reported. The
 * screenshot is of the LAST one, so put the widest page last — for the terminal
 * that is XRAT, an eight-by-eight matrix.
 */
/**
 * `probeOnly` IS THE ANSWER TO THE GUIDE BECOMING EIGHT PAGES.
 *
 * The two jobs this file does are separable, and the split made that matter. The
 * screenshot gates appearance and costs a PNG in git forever; the overflow probe
 * gates responsive collapse, walks the whole DOM, and costs nothing at all. When
 * the guide was one document, listing it once bought both. Eight chapters would
 * buy eight times the bytes for a shape that is the same on all of them — and
 * NOT listing them would silently drop the overflow probe from six of the seven,
 * which is the regression this suite was actually built to catch.
 *
 * So every chapter is probed and two are photographed: the overview, which is
 * the only page carrying the chapter strip and the directory cards, and CONTROLS,
 * which is where the anchor already pointed and where the forced-colors and print
 * fallbacks have the most to get wrong.

 * shape identical on all of them. The guide's CONTROLS chapter is a viewport
 * capture and the paired specimen lives there, so one case costs a screen and
 * covers buttons, a pad, a toggle and the panels around them.
 *
 * WHAT THIS GIVES UP: the rounded path is not gated on the console, server, radar
 * or terminal boards. It is the same CSS on all five — a token override and a
 * corner shape, no per-page markup — so a regression that spared the guide would
 * be a strange one. Every other case still walks every page.

       `transition` has to go for the same reason, and it is not hypothetical:
       initSims paints the toggle state on load, which de-energizes a thumb, and
       .ac-afterglow decays that over --ac-decay-fast — a screenshot taken inside
       that window caught it mid-drain and the suite went intermittently red. The
       token is short enough today that the 250ms wait below would probably cover
       it; that is luck, not a guarantee, and it moves whenever the gas is retuned.

       And the afterglow's scroll smear has to go too, for a reason specific to
       this harness: `fullPage: true` captures a tall page by scrolling it and
       stitching the tiles, which is real scrolling as far as the page is
       concerned. The simulation dutifully blurred whichever tiles happened to be
       mid-stitch, and a tall capture came back different roughly one run in
       three. The `anchor` scroll below would trip it the same way. */
    /* `content-visibility` HAS TO GO TOO, and for the same class of reason.
       docs.css puts `content-visibility: auto` with `contain-intrinsic-size:
       auto 320px` on every specimen tile, which is a real and worthwhile saving
       on a 27,000px chapter. But `auto` means "remember the size this box was
       the last time it rendered", so an off-screen tile's contribution to page
       height depends on whether it has ever been scrolled through — and the
       anchored scroll below therefore lands at a slightly different offset
       depending on render timing. That surfaces as the whole viewport shifted
       one pixel, which a full-frame comparison scores as ~76% changed.

       Forcing every tile to lay out for real makes the capture depend on the CSS
       and nothing else. It costs a little time on the tall chapters and buys a
       suite that cannot fail for a reason that is not a regression. */

       every 13s — so freezing the animation does not photograph it dimmed, it
       photographs it parked at top:0 with no transform, lying across the top
       quarter of every CRT page in a place no reader will ever see it.

       This was invisible until the band started carrying a --ac-flicker-scaled
       trough (sim/crt.css); before that it was a near-transparent screen-blended
       wash and the parked copy scored under tolerance by luck. The band still

           measured on axis-aligned bounds, so a rotated arm reports a box far
           wider than the thing at the end of it — while every one of those marks
           is inside the circle and clipped by nothing.

           The dial cannot overflow its own parent regardless: it carries

           probed at every width.
