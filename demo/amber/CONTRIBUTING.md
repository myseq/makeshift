# Contributing

Thanks for taking a look. This is a genre framework with unusually strict rules, so the most useful
thing to read first is [the six laws](README.md#the-six-laws). Almost every review comment on a
change here comes back to one of them.

## Setup

The main workflow needs **nothing installed** — the build is pure Node (18+).

```bash
node scripts/build.mjs      # or: npm run build
npm run dev                 # build + watch + serve docs/ at :4173
```

Two optional gates need dev dependencies:

```bash
npm install
npm run lint
npm run test:visual
```

## Before opening a pull request

```bash
npm install
npm test             # lint + check + gas + contrast + build — what CI runs
npm run test:visual  # 99 Playwright captures over 14 pages, 43 baselined
npm run test:computed  # 920 computed-style probes
```

`npm test` lints the stylesheets, runs the prohibitions gate (no second hue, no svg, no emoji, no
transitions in components), re-derives the generated gas palettes and fails on drift, recomputes the
contrast table against every palette, and rebuilds `dist/`.

**It leads with `npm run lint`, so `npm test` needs the dev dependencies** — the four gates behind
it do not. If you have not installed anything, `npm run check && npm run gas -- --check && npm run
contrast && npm run build` is the same coverage minus the linter.

**The gas palettes are generated.** `plasma/helium`, `plasma/argon` and `plasma/krypton` are computed
by `scripts/derive-gas.mjs` from the line tables in `scripts/data/emitters.json` — do not hand-edit
those blocks in `colors.css`, change the line table or the selection rule and re-run `npm run gas`.
Neon and `crt/p3` are hand-built and stay that way; neon is in the line table only as the
known-answer gate the pipeline is checked against.

`dist/` is committed on purpose: the demo pages link it directly and GitHub Pages serves them
without a build step. Rebuild before you commit or the demos will be stale.

## Rules that are not negotiable

These are enforced by `scripts/check-prohibitions.mjs`, which fails the build:

> **Two test suites, and they see different things.** `npm run test:visual` compares screenshots; it
> freezes animation and never hovers, so it is blind to which keyframe is running and to every
> `:hover` / `:active` state. `npm run test:computed` reads computed styles for exactly those —
> 920 probes over blink, the persistence layers, the corner styles, the inert states, the meter
> drive levels, and the
> palette as the cascade actually resolves it in each medium. Run both before a release; the
> computed one also runs in CI,
> the visual one cannot (font rasterisation differs on Linux).
>
> **A screenshot suite cannot report a bug its baseline already contains.** The five print captures
> passed for a whole release while `base/print.css` was losing half the palette to a specificity
> tie — they had photographed the broken page and called it correct. That is why the `palette /`
> probes measure contrast instead of comparing pixels.

- **No second hue.** No red, no green, no "success" color. Danger is blink plus inverse video.
  Literal hex is allowed only in `tokens/colors.css`, `base/print.css`, and the two `sim/` files that
  use `#000` inside a `mask-image` (where the value is alpha, not a color).
- **No `transition` anywhere in `src/` except `sim/afterglow.css`, `sim/frame.css`, `base/a11y.css`
  and `base/print.css`.** State changes are instant — a redrawn screen has no
  in-between frames. The only motion in the system is the `steps(1)` blink, the block cursor, and the
  two hardware simulations.
- **No icon set, no emoji, no SVG, no imagery.** Ornament is typographic: `✳ █ ▮ ▯ ▲ ▼ ◄ ►` and
  box-drawing characters, typeset in the terminal font.
- **No `border-radius` above 8px** and no third font family.

And two the linter cannot check:

- **No hairlines on structure.** Every stroke is `var(--ac-border-w)`. `.ac-badge` is the single
  legitimate 1px border, because a chip is not structure.
- **Casing is semantic.** ALL CAPS for system text, Title Case for operator soft keys. Preserve the
  split in every example you write.

## Changing a value

Don't, unless you can show it is a bug. The numbers in `src/tokens/` came from the source design
system and several look odd on purpose — `padding: 8px 24px 20px` on `.ac-tab` is a physical-key
illusion, `min-width: 130px` on `.ac-btn--pad` is a gloved-finger target, the `1px` border on
`.ac-badge` is deliberate.

**Read [RATIONALE.md](RATIONALE.md) before you argue with a number.** It carries the derivation for
most of them — why neon is 24deg, why the drive tiers are three tokens and not one multiplier, why
the two corner paths use different radii — and the comments in `src/` point into it by section. If
the value you want to change has a section there, answer that section.

If you do change one, list it in `CHANGELOG.md` with the reason. Accessibility criteria are a valid
reason; taste is not.

## Adding a component

Derive it from the existing vocabulary. If you cannot justify it from the six laws, it does not
belong here. Every new component needs:

- its own file in `src/components/`, added to the `@import` list in `src/amber-console.css`
- a header comment stating what it is, the minimum markup, and **when not to use it**
- a specimen in `docs/guide-controls.html` or `docs/guide-display.html` with a copyable class string
  and that same caveat
- a row in the README class reference
- correct behavior under `prefers-reduced-motion`, `forced-colors: active` and `@media print`
- a 44×44 minimum hit area if it is interactive, and a `:focus-visible` ring

## The docs pages are partly generated

`docs/` has fourteen pages and all of them carry the same menu bar and the same setup board. Those
live in `docs/_nav.html`, `docs/_board.html` and `docs/_chapters.html`, and `npm run build` expands
them in place between markers:

```html
<!-- @include _board.html emitter="p7" -->
…generated — do not edit…
<!-- @end -->
```

**Edit the partial, not the expansion** — the next build overwrites it. The expansion is committed
so `docs/` still opens over `file://` with no build having been run, and so a diff shows what
actually changed on the page.

The board takes one argument, the emitter the page loads with. Everything that follows from it —
which catalog row is `checked`, whether the JS Effects switch has anything to do, which technology
note is visible — is derived at build time from `src/tokens/colors.css`, so there is no second place
for it to disagree.

## Accessibility is not optional

This aesthetic actively fights accessibility, which is exactly why the gates exist. Anything
interactive needs a visible focus ring on both `--ac-screen` and inverse-video backgrounds. Anything
that signals state must do so without relying on motion or on a single color intensity. Run
`npm run contrast` if you touch the palette, and paste the regenerated table into the README.

## Packaging

Two things in `package.json` look wrong and are not:

- **`devDependencies` never reach a consumer.** npm does not install the devDependencies of a
  dependency, so `playwright` and `stylelint` cost an app that installs `amber-console` exactly
  nothing. They are needed only by `npm run lint` and `npm run test:visual`; `build`, `check` and
  `contrast` are pure Node and need no install at all.
- **`sideEffects` lists the JS builds as well as `*.css`, and must keep doing so.**
  `import "amber-console/js"` is a bare side-effect import — the module auto-initializes and its
  exports go unused — so a bundler told the file is side-effect free will drop it silently. Trim
  that array to `["*.css"]` and the optional behavior disappears from production builds with no
  error anywhere.

## Fonts

Regular weight only, both faces. There is no bold in this system — `base/reset.css` sets
`font-weight: 400` on the headings and the laws put hierarchy in size, intensity and inverse video.
Silkscreen does publish a 700, and fetching it shipped 10.5kb of woff2 for a weight nothing ever
requests. `scripts/fetch-fonts.mjs` asks for regular only; don't add `:wght@400;700` back.

## Commits

Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`), scoped where it helps
(`feat(components): …`). Keep the slices reviewable.
