/**
 * Amber Console — optional PERSISTENCE module.
 *
 * STRICTLY OPTIONAL, AND SEPARATELY OPTIONAL FROM amber-console.js. That split
 * is the point of this file existing:
 *
 *   amber-console.css          every component, and every decay CSS can express
 *                              on its own — de-energizing afterimages, the blink
 *                              off-edge, residual patches, decay-out, and
 *                              cross-document page persistence. Complete alone.
 *   amber-console.js           BEHAVIOR. The tablist keyboard model, dialogs,
 *                              toggles, the DISPLAY presets. No effects.
 *   amber-console.effects.js   THIS FILE. The three persistence phenomena that
 *                              are not reachable from CSS at all.
 *
 * Someone who wants accessible tabs and no eye-candy loads the second. Someone
 * who wants the full phosphor simulation over their own tab implementation loads
 * the third. Neither imports the other, and either works alone.
 *
 * WHAT IS HERE, AND WHY CSS CANNOT DO IT:
 *
 *   1. GHOSTING       text rewritten in place leaves its previous value behind.
 *                     Nothing in the cascade remembers the old string.
 *   2. SCROLL SMEAR   scaled by scroll VELOCITY. CSS scroll-driven animations
 *                     expose scroll POSITION only; velocity is not derivable
 *                     from a timeline, so this cannot move into the stylesheet.
 *   3. FRAMEBUFFER    a real snapshot of the old screen, decaying per pixel.
 *      DECAY          `document.startViewTransition` is the only API that hands
 *                     us one for a same-document change.
 *
 * HOW IT FINDS ITS WORK WITHOUT BEING TOLD. There is no registration call and no
 * event contract with amber-console.js. This file watches the DOM for the two
 * facts it needs — whether `.ac-afterglow` is on the frame, and whether
 * `data-ac-engine` permits it — because both are already in the DOM and
 * observable. A contract between the two modules would be a thing to keep in
 * sync; an observer is not.

 * flag nor a simulation: it is a statement about which of the two files is
 * permitted to contribute. Everything in here is gated on it — ghosting, the
 * scroll smear, and the framebuffer decay in transition() — so one attribute
 * answers "which of these effects need JavaScript" by turning exactly those off.
 *
 * Defaults to on when absent, and the default is duplicated from ENGINE in
 * amber-console.js rather than shared with it. That is a real cost, and the
 * alternative is worse: a module that cannot run without the other one present
 * is not optional.

 * THE SHORTEST TAIL THESE EFFECTS CAN BE SEEN AT, in milliseconds.
 *
 * Mirrored from ENGINE_FLOOR_MS in amber-console.js, duplicated for the same
 * reason engineOn's default is: a module that cannot run without the other one
 * present is not optional. If the two ever disagree, the switch and the work it
 * governs disagree — so they are commented as a pair.
 *
 * THEY DID DISAGREE, and it is worth writing down what that looked like. This
 * number was 5ms — a COMPOSITING floor, asking only "can a frame be drawn at
 * all" — while amber-console.js had already moved to the 80ms PERCEPTUAL one.
 * P1 at 24ms and P3 at 25ms fall between the two, so on those phosphors the JS
 * Effects switch was disabled and painted OFF, the State readout said CSS ONLY,
 * and this file went on cloning ghosts and driving the smear behind both of
 * them. A control that reads OFF while the thing it governs is running is the
 * exact lie the gating in syncEngineControls exists to prevent, told from the
 * other side of the split.
 *
 * SO THE FLOOR IS 80ms IN BOTH FILES, and the long note above ENGINE_FLOOR_MS in
 * amber-console.js is where the reasoning for the number itself lives — briefly:
 * tokens/effects.css has always held that much under ~80ms the eye stops reading
 * a relaxation and starts reading a switch, and the catalog has nothing between
 * 25ms and 105ms, so the threshold is not near anything.
 *
 * WHAT IT COSTS: on P1 and P3, ghosting, the scroll smear and the framebuffer
 * decay all stop — and all three were single-frame flickers there, produced by
 * real work. A ghost was cloned, measured, mounted, given a 25ms animation and
 * removed about one frame later. Not doing that is the point, not the price.

 *   the tail          the phosphor relaxes faster than the eye reads a decay, so
 *                     nothing these effects draw could be seen as persistence
 *
 * amber-console.js disables the JS Effects switch on the last two and paints it

 * This constant is the fix for the single worst bug in the persistence system,

 * spawn its ghost with the FAST duration unconditionally — capped at 400ms — on
 * the reasoning that a continuously-updating field would otherwise smear into
 * its own next value. That reasoning is correct for a 105ms gas panel and
 * exactly backwards for a long phosphor: smearing into the next value is what
 * P39 and P7 DO. It is the entire reason those phosphors were fitted to radar.
 * The result was that the two emitters with the most dramatic persistence in the
 * catalog showed the least, because the code capped it away before the CSS ever
 * saw it.
 *
 * So the rule is now the physical one. A cell rewritten far faster than it can
 * relax genuinely cannot accumulate its own history — the light never gets out
 * of the way — and a cell rewritten slower than that leaves a legible trail of
 * previous values. Four generations is where a trail stops reading as history
 * and starts reading as mush; below that threshold the full tail runs.
 *
 * A clock ticking once a second on a 2000ms P39 tail therefore shows two
 * generations, which is precisely the effect. The same clock on a 105ms neon

 * Every element in or under `el` that occupied MORE space before this style

 *
 * A LIT AREA GETTING SMALLER IS ITS OWN PHENOMENON, and until now nothing
 * modeled it. Every other decay here covers a node disappearing, text being
 * rewritten, or a lamp changing color — but a bargraph does none of those. The
 * element stays, its text is elsewhere, its color never moves; what changes is
 * its WIDTH, so the strip it vacates was lit a moment ago and is now simply not
 * drawn. On a two-second phosphor that was the most visible wrong thing on the
 * panel: everything around the bar trailed and the bar itself snapped.
 *
 * HOW THE OLD GEOMETRY IS RECOVERED, because the obvious way does not work. By
 * the time a mutation is observed the element is already the new size, and
 * cloning it to measure the old one fails for the case that matters: a meter's
 * width is a PERCENTAGE of its track, and a clone parked in .ac-persist has no
 * track to be a percentage of. So the old inline style goes back onto the LIVE
 * element, which still has its real parent, and the rect is read there before the
 * new style is restored. Two forced layouts, synchronous, with no paint between
 * them — nothing flickers, because the browser never gets a frame in the middle.
 *
 * Only SHRINKING counts. Growth is instant, which is the direction rule every
 * other decay in this module follows.
 *
 * THE STYLED ELEMENT IS OFTEN NOT THE ONE THAT SHRINKS, which is the whole reason
 * this returns a list. A meter is driven by writing --ac-meter-value onto the
 * TRACK, and the track is a fixed-width box that never changes size at all — the
 * thing that moves is the BAR inside it, whose width is a percentage of that
 * custom property. Measuring only the mutated element finds nothing and ghosts
 * nothing, which is exactly the bug this function existed to fix.
 *
 * So the element and its immediate children are measured. One level, not the
 * whole subtree: it covers the shape this pattern actually takes — a driven
 * container with the lit region as a child — and keeps the cost a bounded couple
 * of rect reads instead of a walk of everything under a mutated node.

 * Run `fn`, and let the screen it replaces decay per pixel.
 *
 * THIS IS THE ONLY TRUE PERSISTENCE IN THE SYSTEM. Everything else decays an
 * ELEMENT — something the cascade can name. A phosphor decays whatever was
 * drawn, including the parts of the screen no element owns.
 * `document.startViewTransition` snapshots the old frame as an image, and
 * sim/afterglow.css drains that image on the emitter’s own sampled curve while
 * the new frame appears instantly underneath it. Instant up, curve down, applied
 * to the whole screen at once.
 *
 * DISCRETE CHANGES ONLY, and the reason is mechanical rather than aesthetic: a
 * new view transition CANCELS the one already running. Wrapping every text tick
 * would mean a 3000ms P7 snapshot being thrown away 60 times a second and never
 * completing once — strictly worse than not doing it. Tab switches, dialogs and
 * panel swaps are far enough apart to finish. Frequent text keeps the ghost
 * mechanism above, which composes rather than canceling.
 *
 * Declines, and simply runs `fn`, when: the API is absent, motion is reduced,
 * the document is hidden (the API throws InvalidStateError there rather than
 * degrading), the persistence simulation is off, or the page has asked for the
 * CSS-only engine. It is always safe to call.
