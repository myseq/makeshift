/**
 * Amber Console — optional behavior module.
 *
 * STRICTLY OPTIONAL. Every component looks and reads correctly with this file
 * absent; nothing here affects appearance. It exists only for the six things
 * CSS genuinely cannot express:
 *
 *   1. the role="tablist" keyboard model
 *   2. flipping an aria-pressed toggle (the CSS-only .ac-toggle--input variant
 *      needs no JS at all — prefer it when you do not need a <button>)
 *   3. the PLASMA and CRT screen simulations, which persist across reloads, and
 *      the afterglow that rides with CRT — whose ghosts need the value a readout
 *      held one frame ago, the one thing on that list CSS cannot see
 *   4. opening and closing a native <dialog>
 *   5. the DISPLAY presets, which likewise persist — the palettes themselves are
 *      pure CSS and switch on `data-ac-tech` + `data-ac-emitter`, which you can
 *      just as well write into your own markup
 *   6. the STYLE flags, same deal on `data-ac-style-*`
 *
 * THREE AXES, DELIBERATELY SEPARATE, AND NOT INTERCHANGEABLE:
 *
 *   DISPLAY     which hardware is in the panel — a technology plus the gas or
 *               phosphor inside it. Root attributes. Color comes from here.
 *   SIMULATION  what the glass does about it — bloom, scanlines, persistence.
 *               Classes on the frame. Never a color.
 *   STYLE       everything that is not the hardware — comfort and typography
 *               preferences that make no claim about what the panel is.
 *
 * A DISPLAY preset sets the first two at once and then gets out of the way. It
 * is a starting point, not a lock. "Reset to Preset" is the way back, and it
 * restores the STYLE flags and the ENGINE flag too — everything the board can
 * move, it moves back.
 *
 * No dependencies, no build step, no framework. Auto-initializes on DOM ready
 * when loaded with <script type="module" src="amber-console.js"></script>.
 * Using React/Vue/Svelte? Skip it — drive the same ARIA attributes yourself and
 * the CSS follows.

 *                     (a beam on a phosphor). What is making light at all.
 *   data-ac-emitter   which gas, or which phosphor, inside that technology.
 *
 * Root, not the frame, because the palette is not a property of the screen the
 * way .ac-bloom is. Tokens cascade, and a page can put .ac-badge or a code
 * sample outside .ac-screen — scoping the switch to the frame would leave those
 * on whichever palette :root happened to declare, which is the kind of split
 * nobody notices until a screenshot has two hues in it.
 *
 * TWO attributes and not one, because "which color" is not answerable on its
 * own: a gas and a phosphor can be the same color and are not the same thing.
 * Keeping the technology in the selector is what makes it impossible to offer
 * P39 as a gas or krypton as a phosphor — see the header of tokens/colors.css.
 *
 * THE CATALOG IS MARKUP, NOT A TABLE IN HERE. Each preset is a radio:
 *
 *   <input type="radio" name="ac-display" data-ac-display
 *          data-ac-tech="crt" data-ac-emitter="p3" data-ac-sims="crt">
 *
 * so a consumer who ships their own palettes writes their own rows and this file
 * needs no edit. `data-ac-sims` is the space-separated list of simulations that
 * technology implies; every other known simulation is switched OFF. That is the
 * whole preset behavior — pick CRT P3 and the CRT glass comes on and the plasma
 * bloom goes off, in one click, and both toggles move to prove it.
 *
 * A preset is a STARTING POINT, not a lock. Flip a simulation or a style
 * afterwards and the readout says MOD; nothing is prevented.

 *
 * A THIRD AXIS, and it has to be, because it is not the same kind of statement

 * the viewer prefers. ENGINE says how much of the machinery is running — and the
 * answer changes which effects exist at all, without changing either what the

 * have made "does this page run JavaScript" a comfort preference, which it is
 * not.
 *
 * It exists because the split is the library's actual shape and was, until now,
 * only ever described in source comments. Almost everything here is CSS: the
 * bloom, the cell mesh, the scanlines and the vignette, the blink decay, the
 * lingering halo, the residual patches, the radar sweep. Three effects are not,
 * and all three live in amber-console.effects.js — the ghosting of rewritten
 * text, the scroll smear, and the framebuffer decay on discrete swaps. Turning
 * this off leaves exactly those three dark and everything else running, which is
 * a far better answer to "what does the JavaScript buy me" than a paragraph.
 *
 * That file reads this attribute off the root itself; nothing here calls it.
 *
 * A SEPARATE AXIS IS NOT THE SAME AS AN AXIS OUTSIDE THE PRESET, and the two used
 * to be confused here. This flag is still not a style and still not hardware —
 * that is what the paragraph above is defending — but "Reset to Preset" restores
 * it along with everything else, and moving it therefore reads as MOD. See the

 * THE SHORTEST TAIL WORTH OFFERING A SWITCH FOR, in milliseconds.

 * All three JS effects are timed by --ac-persist. Measured against a 60Hz frame,
 * what each phosphor actually buys is:
 *
 *   P11  0.035ms   0.00 frames    nothing is composited at all
 *   P31  0.038ms   0.00 frames
 *   P4   0.06ms    0.00 frames
 *   P1   24ms      1.44 frames    one frame of ghost, then gone
 *   P3   25ms      1.50 frames
 *   gas  105ms     6.3 frames     the :root fallback
 *   P39  2000ms    120 frames
 *   P7   3000ms    180 frames
 *
 * THIS USED TO BE 5ms, WHICH IS A COMPOSITING FLOOR RATHER THAN A PERCEPTUAL
 * ONE. It asked "can a frame be drawn at all", so P1 and P3 cleared it and the
 * module spent real work on them — cloning nodes, mounting them into the
 * persistence layer, animating and removing them — to produce a ghost that
 * survives about one frame. That is not persistence, it is a single-frame
 * flicker, and on the two phosphors most people actually pick.
 *
 * 80ms is the perceptual floor, and it is not a new number: tokens/effects.css
 * has always said that "much under ~80ms and the eye stops reading a relaxation
 * and starts reading a switch". Using the figure the stylesheet already reasons
 * from makes the two agree instead of drawing different lines.
 *
 * The catalog is nowhere near the boundary in either direction — the nearest
 * values are 25ms below and 105ms above — so a single threshold stays safe
 * rather than becoming a fudge.
 *
 * WHAT THIS COSTS ON P1 AND P3: ghosting and the framebuffer decay, both of
 * which were invisible there. It also costs the scroll smear, and that one is
 * deliberate rather than collateral — the smear IS persistence, seen while the
 * image moves. A phosphor that does not hold between frames has nothing to trail
 * with, so a 25ms tube should not smear any more than it should ghost.
 *
 * THE NUMBER IS ENFORCED IN TWO PLACES AND MUST MATCH IN BOTH. This file only
 * paints the switch; PERSIST_FLOOR_MS in amber-console.effects.js is what
 * actually stops the work, and scripts/build.mjs uses the same figure to decide
 * whether a docs board ships the switch enabled. When they drifted apart — this
 * one at 80 and the effects module still at its old 5 — P1 and P3 got a switch
 * that read OFF over a module that was still running. Change one, change all
