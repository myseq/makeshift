    /* STATE CHANGES ARE INSTANT REDRAWS. A screen has no in-between frames, so
       nothing in the framework may ease its way into a new state.

       THIS FILE IS THE SOLE OWNER OF THE RULE. stylelint carried a second,
       overlapping copy of it (declaration-property-value-disallowed-list, with
       its own exemption list in an `overrides` block) and the two had to be kept
       in agreement by hand. This one is now the stricter of the two — it catches
       the longhands, which the stylelint version's `/^transition/` did too but
       which the old regex here did not — so nothing is lost by dropping that.

       The exemptions are the panel's PHYSICS rather than its UI: the decay of a
       phosphor is a timed change and is the one thing here that genuinely is not
       instant. See the header of sim/afterglow.css.

       SPLITTING effects.css MADE THIS LIST MORE HONEST rather than longer. The
       exemption used to cover the whole 1,000-line file — tokens, both hardware
       simulations and the persistence engine — to license the handful of decays
       in one of them. It now names only the two files that actually decay, so a
       `transition` added to the glow tokens or to either hardware simulation
       fails the build the way it always should have. */
