/**
 * Sample a band list into the SAME [[nm, intensity], ...] shape a line table has.
 *
 * A GAS EMITS LINES; A PHOSPHOR EMITS A BAND. That is the one spectral difference
 * between the two technologies, and it is the reason this function exists — but
 * it is deliberately the ONLY place the difference is expressed. Everything
 * downstream (linesToXYZ, the lambda^-4 scatter integral, the gamut fit, the
 * contrast-solved stops) reads a list of wavelengths with intensities and does
 * not care whether a discharge or a powder produced them. Sampling here rather
 * than branching there is what keeps the phosphor pass from forking the
 * pipeline the gases are already validated against.
 *
 * Each band is { nm, fwhm, weight }: a Gaussian in PHOTON ENERGY, centered on the
 * quoted peak, whose width is the quoted FWHM converted to eV at that peak.
 *
 * THE GAUSSIAN IS IN ENERGY, NOT IN WAVELENGTH, AND THAT IS NOT A DETAIL.
 * A luminescence band is a vibronic envelope over a transition between two
 * electronic levels, and that envelope is symmetric in the quantity being
 * emitted — energy. Rendering it in wavelength therefore produces an ASYMMETRIC
 * band with a longer red tail, which is what real phosphor spectra actually
 * look like and what a symmetric-in-lambda Gaussian gets wrong.
 *
 * That is a claim with a number attached. Fitting the published chromaticity of
 * five phosphors with a symmetric-in-lambda Gaussian leaves every one of them
 * MORE saturated than the real screen, by 0.04-0.10 in xy. In energy the same
 * five land within 0.003. The asymmetry is the missing physics, and it costs no
 * new parameter — the shape falls out of the variable the band is symmetric in.
 *
 * The lambda<->energy Jacobian (I_lambda = I_E * |dE/dlambda|) is deliberately
 * NOT applied. It belongs when converting a measured spectral DENSITY between
 * axes; here the band is a model of the envelope itself, and applying it made
 * every fit worse — which is the empirical half of the same argument.
 *
 * 1nm steps against the CMF's own 5nm grid. Oversampling an interpolated table
 * buys no accuracy in the table, but it does stop a narrow band (willemite's
 * ~48nm is ten CMF rows) from landing between samples and losing its peak.
